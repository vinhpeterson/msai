This project is to setup a Minecraft server quickly and easily.
You will need to make mc-install.sh executable. Run the command

chmod 777 mc-install.sh

Then you can run mc-install.sh. DO NOT run it as root, because that will
create the files in the root directory and will be a pain to find
and run.
